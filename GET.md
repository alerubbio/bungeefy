/recommendations
limit
integer
The target size of the list of recommended tracks. For seeds with unusually small pools or when highly restrictive filtering is applied, it may be impossible to generate the requested number of recommended tracks. Debugging information for such cases is available in the response. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.

Default: limit=20
Range: 1 - 100
Example: limit=10
market
string
An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.
If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over this parameter.
Note: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client.
Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings.

Example: market=ES
